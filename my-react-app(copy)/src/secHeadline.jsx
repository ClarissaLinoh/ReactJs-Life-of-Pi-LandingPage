                On June 21, 1977, the cargo ship Tsimtsum sailed from Madras to Canada. 
            On June 2, the ship sank in the Pacific Ocean. Only one lifeboat was lowered, carrying a hyena, a zebra with a broken leg, a female orangutan, a 225-kilogram Royal Bengal tiger, and Pi, a 
            16-year-old Indian boy. For more than seven months, the lifeboat drifted in the fierce blue Pacific Ocean. It is in this ocean that part of the story takes place. 
            It is an extraordinary story full of miracles and, as one of the characters says, it makes people believe in God..
