        <h2>Author's Note</h2>
        <p>
            This book was born as I was hungry. Let me explain. In the spring of 1996, my second book, a novel, came
out in Canada. It didn't fare well. Reviewers were puzzled, or damned it with faint praise. Then readers
ignored it. Despite my best efforts at playing the clown or the trapeze artist, the media circus made no
difference. The book did not move. Books lined the shelves of bookstores like kids standing in a row to play
baseball or soccer, and mine was the gangly, unathletic kid that no one wanted on their team. It vanished
quickly and quietly..
